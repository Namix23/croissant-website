    <p>
      Croissants are yummy. You can eat them with cheese and ham for breakfast
      in France. Or you can turn them into sandwich sandwiches with other foods
      like bacon and eggs for lunch. They are also related to the origin of the
      word "yum."

    <p>Croissants are very delicious and fun to eat</p>
    <p>
      Croissants are a special kind of pastry. They take a while to make, and
      they're easy to mess up. Doing it right is worth the trouble.
